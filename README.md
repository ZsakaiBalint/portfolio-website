# portfolio-website

This repository hosts my portfolio website, made in the symfony framework.
Here is a detailed tutorial on how to get the source code of the project and use this github reposotory for development, using a Windows machine.

## How to get the source code

To get the source code, you can follow these instructions:
1. Create a local directory on your machine where you want to store your symfony projects (optional).
* Open the command prompt, and navigate where you want to create your projects. I will create a folder in the root of my D drive: `D:`
* Create a new folder: `mkdir symfony_projects`
* Navigate into that folder: `cd symfony_projects`
